TigerBeetle can be upgraded without downtime, this is documented in [Upgrading](./upgrading.md).

## Building from Source

Building from source is easy, but is not recommended for production deployments, as extra care is
needed to ensure compatibility with clients and upgradability. Refer to the
[internal documentation](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/tree/main/docs/internals) for
compilation instructions.

## Client Libraries

Client libraries for .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, and Python are published to the respective package
repositories, see [Clients](../coding/clients/).
